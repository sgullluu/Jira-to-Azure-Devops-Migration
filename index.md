Jira To Azure DevOps Migration


Overview:

The Jira to Azure DevOps work item migration tool lets you export data from Jira and import it as work items in Azure DevOps. The migration process is done in two phases, first data is exported from Jira to Json files. This can be done in several batches until the right set of items are ready for import. The second step imports the data files to work items in Azure DevOps.
The key capabilities of the tool include:
•	Jira items are exported based on JQL queries.
•	Users can be translated during migration to maintain proper history.
•	Field mapping is provided to map fields from the source to target account based on configuration file.
•	State mapping between Jira and Azure DevOps states.
•	History from Jira is maintained.
•	Dates such as created or changed date are maintained.
•	Area/Iteration paths can be defaulted to a specific value when they don't exist in the target project.
